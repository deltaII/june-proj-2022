Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans are an ironic take on America’s capitalist culture in that the cans, which are cheap to produce and buy, were sold for such a high price.\nAt the time, the soup cans cost 85 cents each. In 2006, one of the soup cans sold for nearly $12 million. And in 2022, the Campbell Soup Company made over $2 billion in\nprofits. Warhol originally painted the soup cans because they were such a mundane object: they were cheap food produced in cheap factories by poorly-paid workers. Warhol\nsaid that “it [art] should be for the mass of the American people.” Ironically, Warhol’s rendition of the cheap soup cans, originally intended to bring art closer to the\naverage person, was exploited by corporations, becoming a symbol of consumerism and being used in products such as t-shirts.\nhttps://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-cans-1962/ (Alex)
