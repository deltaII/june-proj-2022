Warhol painted the cans to show that the fulfillment of the American dream, while superficially unique, is simply a template. Each can in the painting is the same besides its name. When Campbell creates the cans, they can use the same template can structure and simply change the name on the label. Campbell is a very archetypal American company, and Warhol made a careful decision in choosing to depict it. Thus, one can extrapolate from the soup cans to American society. Each soup can has a different flavor of soup in it, as each individual who pursues the American dream is unique, but each resides in the same template with a slight alteration in packaging.

You walk down the hallway past stacks upon stacks of empty cans waiting to be filled. Of course, you assure yourself, your cans of soup were designed only for you.
