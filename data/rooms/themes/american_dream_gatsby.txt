Fitzgerald uses Gatsby as the epitome of the American dream as a remark on how the Dream is a terrible measure of success. Gatsby grew up poor and became fabulously\n wealthy and popular, the social and financial success Americans have dreamed of. At his funeral, Gatsby’s father, Mr. Gatz, mentions how he used to have a diary about\n self-improvement: “Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He was always\n great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it” (133). Through his self-improvement and chasing after Daisy, Gatsby continues to seek\n more: he wants wealth and he wants love. His desire for growth influences his father too, who beats him: a foreshadowing of the future. Unfortunately for him, his chase\n after Daisy gets him killed, demonstrating how even those who have achieved the American Dream have not been fulfilled.
