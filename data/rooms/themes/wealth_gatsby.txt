Fitzgerald’s contrast between “old” wealth and “new” wealth demonstrates how wealth is not a guarantor of social standing. Gatsby, a self-made millionaire, is worried \nabout his “new” wealth status, and throws lavish parties to attract the attention of Daisy in the hopes of getting in her good graces. In the end, Daisy chooses Tom \nover Gatsby because Tom, unlike Gatsby, has a higher social status: There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered. \nDoubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief” (116). Daisy, “flattered” by Tom’s position, immediately decides to get married to Tom instead of waiting \nfor Gatsby, and ends up staying married to Tom instead of deserting him for Gatsby. Fitzgerald uses the story of Gatsby’s desire for Daisy to show that wealth and and \nsocial standing are correlated, but do not cause one another. (Alex)

The corridor is narrow. You squeeze past the beige wallpaper peeling off to the door on the far left.
