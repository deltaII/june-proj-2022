Gatsby overwhelms Daisy with his wealth to try and prove that he is part of their “old wealth clique. While having Daisy over at his mansion, he brings them into his\n wardrobe room, where he displays his multitudes of shirts: “I've got a man in England who…sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and\n fall.’ … They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds” (71-72). Gatsby surrounds Daisy in a multitude of shirts, “muffling” her\n voice. The word “muffling” implies that the shirts are covering her mouth, and so by literally smothering Daisy with evidence of his wealth, he desperately tries to\n prove he is an authentic “East Egg-er.” Also, by off-handedly mentioning his “man in England” he displays a sense of extreme wealth: only the rich have the connections\n and money to have a dedicated shirt sender. \n(Alex)
