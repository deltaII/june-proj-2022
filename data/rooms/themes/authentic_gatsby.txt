"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall." He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and\nthe soft rich heap mounted higher � shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and\nfaint orange, and monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began\nto cry stormily. �They�re such beautiful shirts,� she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. �It makes me sad because I�ve never \nseen such � such beautiful shirts before.�
