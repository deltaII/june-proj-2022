Consumption of the soup can signifies true Americanness. The Can is immediately recognizable to any American because survival is predicated on buying food from the supermarket where there are entire shelves devoted to cans. The paintings of the cans are arranged in a similar fashion. By buying a can of soup, therefore, you enter into the sphere of living Americans. While other food products have creative and divergent packaging, the Campbell soup has remained constant for years, enabling a romanticization of the past. It also makes the soup cans an easy sign to latch on to. Just as learning Latin defined young menâ€™s masculinity in medieval times, so too does consumption of soup define Americanness.
