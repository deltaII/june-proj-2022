\nWelcome to the signs lobby!

\nSuch an interesting gallery...you made a good choice. Do the works deal with American iconography or are they iconographs themselves? This question is open-ended, much like the choice of paths you can take from here.

You wander down a dimly-lit hallway to the room, passing a painting of eyeballs. You almost missed the painting as if it were invisible.
