On the label to a can of tomato soup, you read the following paragraph:
\n
\nThe undersaturation of the cans wrests the individuality from the workers who make it, reducing them to cogs in a machine. Each soup can is mainly tricolor: red, white, and black. The colors are very dull and appear to be almost fading. Not only do the cans have a very similar appearance, but each can os all the same because you can replace any one for another. Even their shadow is identical, indicating that each was painted under precise conditions. Such a situation is reminiscent of a person posing for a photograph. Each person who receives the photograph feels unique, but the photograph itself remains the same for each coming person. Similarly, the cans have no character; they are alienated from the workers who made them.
