Gatsby uses his appellation of “old sport” to write himself into the American dictionary. After Gatsby and Tom enter the Plaza Hotel, Gatsby refers to Tom with his signature phrase “‘Why not let her alone, old sport?’ remarked Gatsby…‘That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?’ said Tom sharply….‘All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?’” Gatsby’s wealth is not consolidated over generations; still he wants to feel on the social same standing as the East Eggers. His name is as new as his wealth, so it does not have any associations, whereas the Buchanan’s does. Tom sarcastically terms the phrase “a great expression,” indicating both that Tom considers Gatsby’s autonym a mere trifle and that he feels sure enough about his name to deride others. Moreover, no one is willing to hold his hand and guide him through being newly rich.  Therefore, he must be his strongest advocate. He repeatedly uses the term to form an association between “old” money and him, trying to edit the mental vocabulary of signs. He hopes that by establishing himself in the mental system, he can secure his place in the physical.

There's writing on the wall, or rather names. Out of the many, you catch sight of Plato, Shakespeare, and Milton. Who is missing?
